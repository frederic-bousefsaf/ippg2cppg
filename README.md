# iPPG2cPPG: reconstructing contact from imaging photoplethysmographic signals

This repository contains the source codes related to a deep learning model dedicated to the conversion of imaging PPG signals (computed from video) into PPG signals measured by contact sensor placed on the finger or on the ear.

## Scientific description
Available soon

## Requirements
Deep learning models have been developed and learned through Tensorflow+Keras frameworks (2.3.0) over Python 3.5/3.6 . Results were analyzed in MATLAB R2020b.

Different packages must be installed to properly run the codes : 
- `pip install tensorflow` (or `tensorflow-gpu`)
- `pip install opencv-python`
- `pip install matplotlib`
- `pip install scipy`
- `pip install scikit-learn`
- `pip install segmentation-models`


## Usage
Trained U-Net architectures are freely available:
Data employed have not been publicly released but excerpts are available.
